            description: " I’ve been leading the web front of 0byte—“SSL for AI content,” an in-progress zero-knowledge protocol that embeds tamper-evident proofs into AI-generated media and anchors them on Solana. I’m architecting a Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind interface where users can drag-and-drop media, generate proofs, and verify authenticity in a single click. By wiring the UI directly to our Python/Rust SDK via edge APIs, I’ve already cut proof round-trip latency to < 700 ms and added optimistic states for instant feedback. Strict TypeScript contracts, accessibility reviews, and automated tests keep the codebase solid while early user testing shows a 40 % jump in engagement. Working hand-in-hand with my co-founder on the ZK backend, I’m continuously refining features, polishing UX, and guiding 0byte toward a public launch."
